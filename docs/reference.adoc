= Riptide Reference

== Introduction

This document is the primary reference for the Riptide programming language.


== Syntax

Riptide has a very small syntax with only a few rules and only a few forms. This makes Riptide easy to learn, and also allows the Riptide interpreter to be really small and fast.


=== Expressions

Riptide is an expression based language, where nearly every construct is an expression.


=== Lexical scope and variables

Variables must be explicitly declared before they are used. By default, a variable is confined to the lexical scope in which it is defined.


=== Function calls


=== Pipelines


=== Formal grammar

Below is the full specification of the Riptide grammar (in an extended Backusâ€“Naur form):

----
Program             = Block
Block               = (Expr StatementSeparator)* Expr?
Statement           = Expr (Pipe Expr)*
StatementSeparator  = LineTerminator+ | ';'
Expr                = '{' Block '}' | '(' Expr ')' | FunctionCall | String
FunctionCall        = Expr (Whitespace Expr)*
Variable            = '$' [a-Z] [a-Z0-9_]*
String              = BareString | SingleQuotedString | DoubleQuotedString
BareString          = [a-Z0-9_]+
SingleQuotedString  = "'" [^']* "'"
DoubleQuotedString  = '"' [^"]* '"'
Pipe                = '|'
Whitespace          = WhitespaceChar+
LineTerminator      = <CR><LF> | <CR> | <LF>
CharEscapeSequence  = '\' '\'
WhitespaceChar      = '\x20' | '\x09' | '\x0a' | '\x0d'

== Data types

=== Strings

The string is the most fundamental data type in Riptide.


=== Numbers


=== Lists


=== Tables

A table (or associative array) is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key appears at most once in the collection.

Tables are passed by reference instead of by value.

The storage representation of a table is implementation-defined.


== The runtime

At its core, Riptide is an asynchronous pipeline processor.


=== Fibers

A single interpeter process is divided up into multiple execution units, called _fibers_. A fiber represents a single thread of execution in the runtime. Unlike system-level threads or processes which are switched preemptively, a fiber is executed _cooperatively_ with other threads in the process, and only yields to another fiber at specific points.

The runtime schedules these fibers cooperatively within a single process.

Each fiber has a unique ID.

Each fiber has its own standard input, standard output, and standard error streams. All functions called in a fiber that references a standard stream will use the streams from the current fiber by default. If a command is executed, the command process's standard streams are inherited from the current fiber.


=== Exceptions


== Commands

External commands can be executed in the same way as functions are, and use the same function call mechanism.

Native data types passed to a command as arguments are _coalesced_ into strings and then passed in as program arguments. The function call waits for the command to finish, then returns the exit code of the command as a number.


== Modules


== Builtins

This section of the reference describes all of the built-in functions that must be provided by the Riptide runtime for any program.


=== Core functions

==== `def`

Define a new variable.


==== `builtin`

Call the builtin function with the given name and arguments.


==== `command`

Execute an external command as a function.


==== `help`

Print out user help for using Riptide.


=== Input and output

==== `print`

Writes each argument given to standard output.


==== `println`

Writes each argument given to standard output, with a trailing newline separator.


==== `echo`

An alias for `println`.


==== `eprint`

Writes each argument given to standard error.


==== `eprintln`

Writes each argument given to standard error, with a trailing newline separator.


=== Working with strings

==== `str?`

Check if the given values are strings.


==== `str:format`


==== `str:match`

Applies a regular expression to a string and emits matches and captures.


==== `str:replace`

Applies a regular expression to a string and replaces matches with the received values.


=== Tables

==== `table-get`

==== `table-set`


=== Stream functions

==== `send`

Sends one or more values to the current output channel.


==== `recv`

Receives a value from the input channel.


=== Process management

==== `pid`

Returns the PID of the current process.


==== `exit`

Terminate the current process, with an optional status code.

NOTE: By default, all child processes will also be terminated in as safe a manner as possible before the current process exits. Child processes that do not respond will be terminated forcefully. To bypass this behavior, pass the `--orphan` flag.


==== `spawn`

Spawn a new process and execute a given block within it. Returns the PID of the new process.

Calling `spawn` will never interrupt the current fiber; the spawned fiber will not be started until at least the current fiber yields.


==== `kill`

Send an interrupt or signal to a running process.


==== `sleep`

Suspend the current process for a given amount of time.


==== `exec`

Execute a command, replacing the current process with the executed process.

NOTE: Like `exit`, `exec` will do its best to clean up the current process as safely as possible before replacing the current process.

WARNING: This replaces the current _process_, which includes all fibers in the current process.


=== Fiber management

==== `current-fiber`

Returns the ID of the current fiber.


==== `fiber-set`

Set a fiber-local value.
